# Vroomba
R/C motors, ESC, and battery built into a broken WYZE robot vacuum, which is custom-cut to fit components.

🪵 Vroomba
Vroomba is a passion project that recycles a dysfunctional robot vacuum into a fun, cost-effective, simple r/c car.
It combines physical design alteration, CAD, 3D printing, and cost optimization, along with trial/error and creative design, to create the world's fastest robot vacuum.
Using 2 brushed 775 motors, 90A continuous ESCs, a 3:1 3D printed gearbox, and a 16.8V 4S battery, although with 65mm diameter 1/10 RC rubber wheels.

An iRobot converted with 2 775 motors, 60A ESCs, 3:1 planetary gearboxes, larger custom polyurethane wheels, and a 16.8V 4S battery. With a measured top speed of 35mph, my robot theoretically beats it by an extraordinary 0.5 MPH, still a win. I actually only found the video halfway through the project, which gave me the idea for a planetary gearbox, which unfortunately didn't work. 

🎯 Why this project?
I originally wanted to just harvest the parts from the robot for my smaller Arduino projects, or just playing around, but once I looked inside, I realized the possibilities for the frame, and wanted to experiment and build an r/c robot vacuum.

🧰 How to build your own
You can build your own robot, although there aren't steps due to the multitude of different designs.
1. Frame
Your frame holds all your parts and is the base of your robot. Make sure your frame is strong enough to carry a load and withstand crashes, and if you need to remove material, make sure to retain rigidity. Measure the dimensions of your frame, and create a primitive model. Normally, robot vacuums can fit 2*775 motors, although the gearbox design will have to be modified based on the frame. You can try and use brushless motors, although they will be much more expensive and complicated to implement. Brushed 550 motors are smaller and will fit much better, without a very large performance decrease. ESCs, Batteries, and other components are varied from design, but make sure everything is compatible with one another.
